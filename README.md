## Inspiration and Alternatives
XXXXXXX was inspired byâ€¦

Read Me Template was inspired by a [blog post](https://changelog.com/top-ten-reasons-why-i-wont-use-your-open-source-project/) on [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/).
The [contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) file was heavlily influenced by [HTML 5 boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). The README.md is an amalgamation of several different READMEs. The "features" included were picked because of common practices, design, and UX.
Future versions may include some of the recommendations found on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2304863/how-to-write-a-good-readme)
